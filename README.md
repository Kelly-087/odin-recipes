## My Recipe Page

This is my first project as part of the Odin Project. 
I will use my beginning knowledge of HTML and git. 
I have learned how to set up HTML boilerplate, navigate terminal and use it to create directory and files.
Alongside this I also include paragraphs, images and lists- both ordered and unordered. 
I have kept an accurate and meaningful commit log.
